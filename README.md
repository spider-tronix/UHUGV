# UHUGV
Unmanned Hybrid Underwater Ground Vehicle

# Modules:

Before Reopening:

    - Design of underwater locomotion
    - Design of Ground locomotion
    - Integrating both these designs.
    - Kalman filter to get accurate theta, omega, alpha values from the sensor
    - Mathematical Modelling of the fin's motion. (Serpenoid Motion)
    - Importing the simulation framework from Arboc
    - Setting up URDF
    - Setting up the simulation environment
    - LQR control on the amplitude of the wave for each fins
    - Validation of the control algorithm in simulation

After Reopening:

    - 3D Printing of the Bot
    - Fabrication of the Bot
    - Embedded Coding, and shifting everything to Hardware
    - Validation of Simulation results by implementing in Hardware
    - Literature
    
Control Aspect:

    - Kalman filter for IMU
    - Mathematical modelling of sting ray / serpenoid motion
    - Differential Drive
    - Control algorithm for servos based on the mathematical model with feedback from IMU
